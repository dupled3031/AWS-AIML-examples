# AWS-AIML-examples

## Prerequisites

You need an AWS account for these labs, and depending on the lab you also need a role with administrator access on the account to configure the neccessary IAM roles.

### Step 1 - Set up your Sagemaker Jupyter Notebook instance

In the AWS console, navigate to Sagemaker. Then select, **Notebook** | **Notebook Instances**. Click the **Create Notebook instance** button.


Notebook instance name: aimlbootcamp
Notebook instance type: any xlarge instance type
Git repositories:
> Choose "Clone a public Git repository to this notebook only"

> Git repository URL: https://github.com/dupled3031/AWS-AIML-examples.git

Click **Create Notebook Instance**
Choose a name for the notebook, for example "aimlbootcamp" as the instance name. 
You can bump the instance size up to extra large.  

The instance will take about five minutes to start up. In the mean time, proceed to step 2.

### Step 2 - apply lab credits if you have any

Navigate to the account link at the top right of your window.

Select **Account**. Then navigate down to **Credits** and enter in the coupon.
